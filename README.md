# EV_Battery_Life_Prediction

**Predicting the Remaining Battery Life and Degradation Rate of Electric Vehicles using Machine Learning**

## Project Overview
This repository contains a professional, week-by-week project for predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) and degradation rate of EV batteries. It includes data, reports, and starter code for preprocessing and building ML models.

## Quick start
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Explore `Week_1/Docs/Report_Week1.md` and `Week_2/Docs/Report_Week2.md`.
4. Run preprocessing code:
```bash
python Week_2/Code/main_week2.py
```
5. Launch Streamlit demo (Week 1 placeholder UI):
```bash
streamlit run Week_1/Code/main_week1.py
```
