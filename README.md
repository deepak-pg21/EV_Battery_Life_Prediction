EV Insight is a predictive maintenance and analytics web app for electric vehicles (EVs).  
It forecasts remaining battery charge cycles, estimates battery replacement cost, and computes a Battery Health Index (BHI) using hybrid ML models and real-world telemetry.  
With a responsive Streamlit dashboard and optional OpenAI chatbot, it’s built for vivid insights, rapid deployment, and easy extension.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Battery Life Prediction: Model remaining charge/discharge cycles with real-world usage, temperature, and voltage telemetry.
- Cost Estimation: Forecast battery replacement price using model, age, brand, and regional price data.
- Battery Health Index: Aggregates predictive outputs into a concise battery health score (0–100%).
- Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit web UI with visual analytics and AI explanations.
- Hybrid ML Pipeline: Uses regression (for cycle/cost) and ensemble classification (for health score).
- AI Chatbot: OpenAI GPT-powered chat mode with local fallback for Q&A and predictive explanation.
